## Introduction

Heya,

I thought it would be a good idea to just write a post about a project that I have started to work on. It's still in it's infantile stages of development where everything is still being figured out and where systems are just beginning to be developed. But I believe that through that just by documenting the stages of the development of this project, may help in the long run when it comes to negative things such as burnout.

## What is it?

The working title of this project is "Up and through the Mountain" this may change during development, either due to a major narrative change (which is unlikely), or another reason such as the name already being taken during the later stages of development.

The overall premise of the game is that there is a major war that is devastating the ecosystem, and the player, a father within a family of foxes needs to travel *up and through a mountain* to reach an animal sanctuary that will protect them from harm.

## How long?

The game is expected to be around one to one-and-a-half hours long, the majority of this time being spent solving puzzles and the exploration of the various areas you will discover through the climb up and through the mountain. I do not want to create a game that is over two hours long as I would like to actually finish the project within my lifetime.

## How will it be developed?

To aid with me completing this project relatively quickly I am going to try to use a relatively simple art design, this includes 2D character sprites, and a 3D pixel art-esque environment inspired by \[OCTOPATH TRAVELLER]**(**https://store.steampowered.com/app/921570/OCTOPATH_TRAVELER**/)** *(see below).*

[OCTOPATH TRAVELLER](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/921570/ss_4e3218569723259a23262ec23cb0ebb6226e46b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688650598)

I am not very good at art, hence why I have decided to go for a pixel-art design. Some additional art / help with art might be done by my friend Nicole. She is a very lovely artist and alot better than me.

## Template I have created to help me

\
Alongside using a more restrictive art design, I have also decided to utilise pre-existing unity packages / example projects and change them to suit the project. For example, the player's movement system is adapted from the \[Super Simple 2D Kit](https://github.com/atmosgames/SuperSimple2DKit) created by Thomas Brush / Atmos Games. I changed this basic kit by converting the 2D platforming movement to 3D movement which was pretty easy, the conversion is *not* perfect by any means however. Some little things such as running particles remain unfinished and some systems I have personally changed, such as the dialogue system. My adaptation of the project can be found on my \[Azure](https://dev.azure.com/upsilondiesbackwards/Third%20Person%20Example%20Project) **Note: Some aspects of this project may be broken or need tweaking to get working!**

That is all I have to share about the project right now! I will keep posting about this and other projects that I work on, Thanks for watching!\
