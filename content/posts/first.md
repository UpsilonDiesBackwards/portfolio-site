# Well hello there!

Hi, my name is Tayler, a UK-based software / game developer, keen support of FOSS, and avid oxford comma user. This site has multiple purposes, mostly centered around technology, software, and other random things that might interest me.

## Purpose of site
The primary purpose of this website is to serve as a sort of portfolio that showcases my various skills, projects, and experience regarding software engineering and game development. I will also share blog posts regarding techniques and skills that I may use, sharing tutorials on how to create pieces of software, and showcasing my projects that I am working on / completed, notably my golang rendering engine, and my in-development Unity project.

I hope you learn something new from this site!

Toodles
