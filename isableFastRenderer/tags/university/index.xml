      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hello-friend&#34;&gt;Hello Friend&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hot minute since my last post on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just before Christmas I started the fourth and final game jam of my first year of university and me and my team had to decide on a brief that was created by the then-current second year students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-brief&#34;&gt;The Brief&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The briefs that we were supplied with seemed strange. There was &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of Hades-clones or games that, to-us didn&amp;rsquo;t sound too coherent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;heya-long-time-no-see&#34;&gt;Heya, Long time no see!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while hasn&amp;rsquo;t it? But it&amp;rsquo;s been a busy while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months I have been busy at university developing a few game projects within groups and it has been quite the journey. I have made around three games at the moment, with the forth and most ambitious one starting next term. Out of all of the projects I have made so far, I believe that the first one is the hidden little gem out of the three, especially considering how many constraints that was on this particular project compared to the others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
